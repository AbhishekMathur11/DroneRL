Reinforcement Learning for Drone and Manipulator Control

This repository explores the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), for controlling drones and manipulators in dynamic environments. The utilization of RL algorithms enables the autonomous agents to learn adaptive control policies through interactions with their surroundings.

## Controlling Drones with RL

Drones pose unique challenges in terms of stability, navigation, and obstacle avoidance, making them an ideal candidate for RL-based control systems. RL allows drones to learn from experience, continually refining their control policies based on feedback from the environment. In this context, the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm stands out for its efficiency in optimizing complex policies while ensuring stability during the learning process.

## PPO Algorithm Overview

Proximal Policy Optimization is a state-of-the-art RL algorithm designed for policy optimization, particularly suitable for scenarios where safety is a critical concern. The algorithm directly optimizes the policy of an agent parameterized by a neural network. The core objective is to maximize the expected cumulative reward while enforcing a constraint on the policy update. The algorithm achieves this through a surrogate objective function:

\[ L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}\left[\min\left(r_t(\theta)A_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon)A_t\right)\right] \]

- \( \theta \): Policy parameters.
- \( r_t(\theta) \): Probability ratio between the new and old policies.
- \( A_t \): Advantage function representing the discounted sum of future rewards.
- \( \epsilon \): Clipping parameter.

PPO's formulation ensures stability and controlled learning by preventing significant deviations from the previous policy.

## Application to Manipulators

Expanding RL to manipulators involves addressing challenges related to high-dimensional state and action spaces. Manipulators, with multiple degrees of freedom, demand advanced control strategies for precise movements. PPO's capability to handle continuous action spaces makes it well-suited for manipulator control. The policy network outputs continuous control signals, enabling manipulators to perform intricate and precise movements with inherent stability.

## Mathematical Rigor of PPO

PPO's mathematical foundation involves a nuanced understanding of policy optimization. The surrogate objective function strikes a balance between policy improvement and stability, achieved through the clipping mechanism. The probability ratio \( r_t(\theta) \) and advantage function \( A_t \) play crucial roles in shaping the policy update, providing controlled exploration and exploitation.
